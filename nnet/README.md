# nnet

A (relatively) simple feed-forward neural network in NumPy/Cython.
Only basic layers for multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks are implemented.

This code is meant as an example implementation and for small experiments.
Its performance does not scale to large quantities of data!
